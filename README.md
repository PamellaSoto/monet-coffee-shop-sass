## 🏡 **Monet’s Coffee Shop (Responsive SCSS/JS Website)**  
A dream-come-true institutional website for a cozy imaginary café—built with love **and** all the web design skills I’ve mastered.  

### **🛠️ Stack:** SCSS (Sass), JavaScript, HTML5  
### **✨ Why it’s special:**  
🌸 Whimsical yet professional design  
📱 Fully responsive
🎀 Charming interactions & subtle animations  
💡 My *"aha!"* moment project after learning web dev  

Designed to feel like a warm hug through a screen. No coffee required. ☕ (…Okay, maybe pretend-coffee.)  

*"The website I daydreamed about coding—now real!"*
