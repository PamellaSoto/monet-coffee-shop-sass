About Section
"Monet's Coffee Shop was founded by two art students who fell in love with coffee craftsmanship. Inspired by the impressionist masters and the vibrant energy of Central Park, we've created a space where every cup is a work of art. Our beans are ethically sourced from small farms, and our pastries are baked fresh daily using traditional French techniques."
